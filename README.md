# Postgres-Data-visualization-using-KML
USED POSTGRES to visualize data using kml in google earth.

Project includes:
1) Placemarks in KML file and visualizing using .kml in Google Earth.
2) Finding nearest neighbours to a given point and then visualize and verify results using .kml in Google Earth.
3) Convex Hull formation of all the placemarks and then visualize and verify results using .kml in Google Earth.
4) Construct a SPIROGRAPH to generate a set of coordinates (in java) centred around a placemark and then generate a .kml using POSTGRES
 to visulaize the geometry in Google earth.
 
 # All the queries, screenshots, java code for coordinate generation and KML files have been uploaded !
